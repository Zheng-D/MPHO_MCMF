# MPHO_MCMF
This project proposes a multi-core parallel hybrid optimization algorithm (MPHO) for solving the MCMF model. Its input is a binary mutation matrix $A$, a function similarity network $Q_F$, and parameters $K$. Its output is a set of genes corresponding to the submatrix $M$. In the MPHO_MCMF method, the calculation of individual fitness is very time-consuming due to the large number of genes and samples. Therefore, the calculation of individual fitness is split into a set of independent computational tasks and distributed to multi-core processors for simultaneous execution.
